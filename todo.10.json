  "task_id": 10,
  "scope": "Realism: Durability & Resource depletion",
  "goal": "Add simple durability to tools and make gathering nodes deplete and respawn so resource usage feels grounded.",
  "decisions": [
    "Track durability per tool type (Axe/StoneAxe/Knife/StoneKnife) on the player; decrement on use and break/remove when it hits zero.",
    "Model foraging depletion per tile via a small charge/cooldown pool seeded by biome; trees already use hits, so keep that flow intact.",
    "Keep recipes and inventory unchanged; share durability across copies of the same tool for simplicity."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Add persistence fields for tool durability and per-tile foraging nodes with defaults; seed nodes lazily based on biome.",
    "Apply durability loss on use interactions (forage, chop, knife processing, firewood) and break tools with feedback when exhausted.",
    "Gate foraging by local charges; drain on success, set a cooldown, and respawn after a short delay; add player-facing messages.",
    "Run cargo check and update todo tracking."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "No per-item unique durability; durability is tracked per tool type.",
    "Tree chopping already depletes trees; focus depletion on foraging nodes."
  ],
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": [
    "Player state now stores tool_durability for axe/stone axe/knife/stone knife; use flows drain durability and break/remove the tool with a pending message at zero.",
    "Foraging nodes are tracked per tile with biome-seeded charges and cooldown-based respawn; depleted tiles block foraging until they recover.",
    "Gather/processing flows apply durability and depletion, with cargo check passing after the changes."
