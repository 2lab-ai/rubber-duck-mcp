  "scope": "System Core: Tile & Object",
  "goal": "Represent tiles with placed objects (cabin, wood shed, trees, furniture) plus visibility rules.",
  "decisions": [
    "Introduce a tile object model (kind, size, supports surface/attachments) and keep terrain as separate ground data.",
    "Place cabin/wood shed/trees as objects on tiles rather than special tile types; persist objects with their state.",
    "Define size-based visibility: default near (1 tile), large objects (2), trees (3), cabin-scale (5)."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Add world object definitions and a per-tile/position object registry that can serialize with game state.",
    "Update world generation/state init to spawn objects (cabin, wood shed, tree placeholders, basic surfaces) on tiles.",
    "Refactor movement/look/examine/description to consume the object registry and apply new visibility ranges."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Surfaces (e.g., table/wall) are objects that can hold items or attachments.",
    "Legacy item interactions (inventory, fireplace) stay but are reached via their object instances."
