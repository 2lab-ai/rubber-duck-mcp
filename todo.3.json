  "goal": "Add XP tracking per skill and ensure every 'use' action maps to a skill gain.",
  "decisions": [
    "Keep existing skill level fields for compatibility but back them with per-skill XP progress data.",
    "Use simple level-up thresholds (10 + 5 * level) and cap levels at 100.",
    "Award skill XP on all universal use flows (foraging, chopping, processing, fire handling, blueprint crafting)."

  "plan": [
    "Add SkillProgress storage and XP helpers while keeping serde compatibility.",
    "Wire universal use interactions to call improve() for their matching skills.",
    "Verify builds/tests and update todo.json with progress."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Progress map seeds from existing level values so old saves stay valid.",
    "Skill IDs remain string-based and reuse the existing skill names."
