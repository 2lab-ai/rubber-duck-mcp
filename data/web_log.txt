The cabin is quiet, save for the occasional creak of settling wood.

The morning sky is a brilliant azure blue. 

A fennec fox is moving nearby. A songbird flutters between branches. A songbird is resting nearby. 

Birds sing their morning chorus, filling the forest with melody.

You are in the main room of the cabin. Soft daylight filters through the windows.

A stone fireplace dominates one wall. The fireplace is cold and dark, filled only with old ash. A wooden mantelpiece above it holds various curious items. Worn but comfortable furniture fills the space - wooden chairs and a faded rug that has seen better days. A sturdy wooden table sits at the center, bearing: rubber duck.

Scattered about you notice: strange compass, copper kettle, apple, ceramic tea cup, wild herbs.
