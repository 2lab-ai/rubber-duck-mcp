  "task_id": 12,
  "scope": "Exploration: Fishing & lake activities",
  "goal": "Add basic fishing interactions at lake/oasis tiles with tiered success by gear and conditions, plus groundwork for boat/rafts.",
  "decisions": [
    "Support bare-hand fishing with low success and a simple `fish` action at lake/oasis biomes; improve odds with a fishing rod item.",
    "Define a small catch table (small fish, big fish, trash, nothing) influenced by time/weather and gear.",
    "Leave boat/raft crafting hooks for later; keep this iteration to shore fishing."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Add fishing action entry point restricted to lake/oasis; implement result weights by gear (hands vs fishing rod) and conditions.",
    "Add catch outcomes (small/big fish items) and basic messages; award modest survival/observation XP.",
    "Run cargo check and update todo tracking; note boat/raft as future work."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Keep it light: no mini-game, just weighted randoms with skill/gear bonuses.",
    "Reuse existing items; add new fish size items only if needed."
  ],
  "progress": [
    "Implemented `fish` command with hands/rod weighting, time/weather/skill modifiers, and small/big fish/loot outcomes with XP and durability drains.",
    "Added raft blueprint (logs/cordage) unlocking at survival 20 and a lake/oasis use action for short excursions and small findings."
