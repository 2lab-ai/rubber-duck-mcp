  "task_id": 20,
  "scope": "Content: Cabin Pig Butchering Tutorial",
  "goal": "Create an early-game tutorial scenario where the player finds a small pig carcass and a knife by the cabin, learns to butcher it, and cooks the meat on the fireplace.",
  "decisions": [
    "Spawn a small pig corpse and a knife on the path in front of the cabin in the initial world state so they appear naturally in the first few looks/moves.",
    "Use the existing tutorial book or a short ambient message to hint at taking the knife and using it on the pig to learn butchering.",
    "Ensure the yields are modest (a few pieces of meat, a small hide, some fat) and that cooking the meat over the cabin fire is clearly supported by the existing cooking system."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Place a small pig corpse object and a knife near the cabin in the initial state/persistence bootstrap.",
    "Add or update tutorial text to gently direct the player toward taking the knife, butchering the pig, and bringing the meat inside.",
    "Verify that butchering the pig grants meat, hide, and fat, and that the meat can be cooked on the cabin fireplace using the current cooking flow."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Tone should emphasize respect and gratitude for the animal rather than gore or shock.",
    "This tutorial should remain optional and non-blocking; players who ignore the pig can still progress via foraging and fishing."
