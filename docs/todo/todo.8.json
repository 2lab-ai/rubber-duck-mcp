  "task_id": 8,
  "scope": "Simulation: Wildlife Behaviors & Observation",
  "goal": "Define biome-based wildlife spawn tables with activity cycles, make behaviors react to time/weather, and surface richer observation from the cabin terrace and in the field.",
  "decisions": [
    "Keep the existing species roster but gate spawn locations by biome bands (desert west, spring north, winter east, lake center) and time-of-day activity (diurnal/nocturnal/crepuscular).",
    "Use a lightweight activity-state update that factors time of day and severe weather (rain/blizzard/sandstorm reduces movement/hunting).",
    "Observation detail scales with observation skill; terrace view offers a direction-based snapshot with distance hints."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Refine spawn tables: map species -> native biomes + spawn weights per region; seed spawns accordingly and allow rare lake/edge sightings.",
    "Update wildlife update loop to respect activity schedules and weather dampening; add simple distance-aware movement limits per biome band.",
    "Add observation outputs: terrace directional look shows nearby wildlife with distance bands; field descriptions include activity cues scaled by observation skill.",
    "Smoke test commands (look/observe/terrace) to ensure no panics and messages show activity/weather influences."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "No new species or items; focus on behavior/observation fidelity.",
    "Keep performance light—no pathfinding beyond random moves within valid map bounds."
