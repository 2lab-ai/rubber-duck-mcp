  "task_id": 2,
  "scope": "Interaction: Universal Use Handler",
  "goal": "Handle gathering (tool/hands -> resource), processing (tool -> item), and building (material -> blueprint) with clear routing and feedback.",
  "decisions": [
    "Support bare-hands foraging alongside tool-based gathering in the universal use command.",
    "Route building automatically to the active blueprint when the supplied material matches required inputs, even if the target isn't spelled out.",
    "Return instructive failure messages that hint at the valid use patterns instead of a generic 'can't use' response."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Add hands-aware handling for foraging targets and keep energy/time costs consistent with other use actions.",
    "Tighten blueprint routing so materials can be applied to the active project without requiring 'blueprint' in the target.",
    "Improve the universal use fallback messaging to guide players toward supported patterns."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Keep the handler single-entry (try_use) but branch by interaction type before failing.",
    "Action time/energy is already applied via ActionSuccess; reuse that for the new flows."
  ]
