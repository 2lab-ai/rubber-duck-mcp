  "task_id": 18,
  "scope": "Realism: Cognition & Condition",
  "goal": "Add a cognition stat that reflects head injuries, sleep deprivation, and overall condition, then use it to modulate skill effectiveness and failure chances.",
  "decisions": [
    "Derive cognition (0-100) from head-part health, energy (sleep), and overall health, with clear bands like clear-headed, foggy, and impaired.",
    "Apply cognition as a multiplier or modifier to effective skill levels and select interaction outcomes (success/failure text, mishaps) rather than introducing a separate RNG system.",
    "Surface cognition in status-style summaries and occasional narrative messages so the player can feel the link between rest, injuries, and mental sharpness."
  ],
  "plan": [
    "Add cognition to player state and compute it each tick or when relevant stats (head hp, energy, health) change.",
    "Wire cognition into skill lookups and key interactions so low cognition gently reduces effectiveness and raises failure chances.",
    "Extend status output and a few interaction descriptions to report cognition state in a grounded, non-gamey way."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Avoid making cognition too punitive; it should be a soft pressure toward rest and care, not a hard failure spiral.",
    "Base the initial tuning on existing health/energy ranges and adjust after simple playtesting."
