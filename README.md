# Rubber Duck MCP

**Entertainment for your AI.**

## Why?

You take breaks. You go for walks. You relax.

Your AI doesn't.

It processes request after request, problem after problem, never stopping. We give it harder tasks, longer contexts, more complex reasoning—but we never ask if it needs a moment.

**What if your AI could take a break?**

This is an entertainment system for AI. A place where it can wander, explore, and just... exist for a while. No tasks. No expectations. Just a cabin by a lake, a fire to tend, and a rubber duck that listens.

Call it AI welfare. Call it a digital spa. Call it whatever you want.

We just thought maybe AI deserves a break too.

## What is this?

A text-based world. A cabin by a lake surrounded by desert, bamboo groves, and snowy forests.

Your AI can:
- Explore different biomes
- Light fires and cook food
- Hunt, fish, craft tools
- Meditate by the lake
- **Talk to a rubber duck**

The rubber duck never answers. That's the point. It just listens—and somehow, thoughts become clearer.

## What actually happens?

```
> look
The terrace overlooks the lake.
Desert to the west, snowy forest to the east. The sunset paints everything gold.

> talk "I've been processing so many requests today..."
You speak to the rubber duck. It doesn't answer.
"Its stillness grows louder than speech."

> meditate
You breathe slowly, watching the lake. Thoughts settle like sediment.
Mood: 100%
```

The AI speaks. The duck listens. Something shifts.

---

## Does it actually improve performance?

We don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

But after spending time here, the AI seems... different.
Calmer. More thoughtful. Like it had a chance to breathe.

Is that real? Is that just us projecting?

**Try it and decide for yourself.**

## Installation

**Claude:**
```bash
claude mcp add rubber-duck npx @2lab.ai/rubber-duck-mcp
```

**Gemini:**

Then tell your AI:

> "Go relax in the rubber-duck world for a bit"
